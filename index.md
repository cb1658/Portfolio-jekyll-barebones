# Example Student Portfolio

Follow along online with our [Zoom Session for the Tuesday 1 April Class.](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89801627815?pwd=50OLJZQrdI3hsAsckgiUSlKeWFncLl.1) 

This site is a simple portfolio template for students to showcase their work, 
projects, and interests. It is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
The template is designed to be easy to customize and adapt to your own style.

To get started with your own portfoilio, you can either [create a new Github repo 
and setup Github Pages](./howto), or you can [fork this repo](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Portfolio-jekyll-barebones)
and edit the files  with your own content.

One of my favorite projects is a [simple dino jump game I
created](./html/dino.html). It's a browser-based game where a pixelated dinosaur
leaps over obstacles to score points. While the concept is straightforward, I
enjoyed the challenge of implementing smooth animations and responsive controls.
It was a fun way to practice JavaScript and game design principles.

In my free time, I also enjoy baking, and my favorite recipe is for [homemade
focaccia](./html/focaccia.html). The process of kneading the dough and infusing it with olive oil,
rosemary, and sea salt is incredibly satisfying. The result is a golden, fluffy
bread that's perfect for sharing with friends or enjoying as a snack.
